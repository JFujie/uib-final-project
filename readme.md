# UIB Final Project

## Portfolio Website

![Portfolio Preview](./src/img/portfolio-preview-final.png)

This is my final project for the _User Interface Basics_ module of the Web Development course @ DCI.

As I continue to hone my skills and learn new things, this Website will evolve.

Consider it a work in progress. 😊
